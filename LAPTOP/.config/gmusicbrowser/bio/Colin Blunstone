<title>Artist Biography</title>
In the 60's, Colin Blunstone was the lead singer of The Zombies, a british band that developed a distinctive, jazzy sound, in which his soft, laid-back, almost hesitant voice was offset against the equally soft, but flexible and pointy instruments of organ, drum, and bass.  The Zombies disbanded.  In the early 70's, Blunstone re-emerged as a solo act, and scored several major hits.  The music featured rhythm guitar now and ranged from string arranged melodies, to rock, to American folk.  The Zombies were never far away; for instance, "Andorra", written by co-Zombies Rod Argent and White, is a remake of "Time of the Season".  "One Year" was his first solo album.    In the late 70's Colin lent his voice to The Alan Parsons Project, a logical progression from his solo work, as can be heard in a song such as "Old And Wise".   Colin is currently touring and recording again with Rod Argent, another founder member of the Zombies, performing both new material and hits from their joint and solo careers.
