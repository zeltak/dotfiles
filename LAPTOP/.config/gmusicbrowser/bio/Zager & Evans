<title>Artist Biography</title>
Zager & Evans was a Lincoln, Nebraska rock-pop duo of the late 1960s and early 1970s, named after its two members, Denny Zager and Rick Evans. Artists Dave Trupp and Mark Dalton backed up the duo.  Zager & Evans are only known for their immensely popular song In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus), written by Rick Evans. It hit number one on the UK chart in 1969. Coincidentally, it was number one on 20 July 1969 in USA, the date of the first manned moon landing by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and spent six weeks on the Billboard Top 40. It was nominated for a special Hugo Award that same year.  The band signed with RCA records, who claimed they were "The Next Big Thing", but follow-up singles, such as "Mr. Turnkey", went unnoticed by the public.
