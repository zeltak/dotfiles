<review>An odds-and-sods collection assembled after John Bonham's death, Coda is predictably a hit-or-miss affair. The best material comes from later in Led Zeppelin's career, including the ringing folk stomp of "Poor Tom," the jacked-up '50s rock & roll of "Ozone Baby," and their response to punk rock, the savage "Wearing and Tearing." The rest of the album -- sadly including the Bonham showcase "Bonzo's Montreux" -- is average, despite the presence of some stellar playing, especially on the early blues-rock blitzkrieg "I Can't Quit You Baby" and "We're Gonna Groove." </review>
