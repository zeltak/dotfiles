<review>If Colin Blunstone had only recorded the hits by the Zombies (such as "Tell Her No," "Time of the Season," and "She's Not There") he should and would be a household name. However, Blunstone had an equally impressive solo career. This collection documents his excellent Epic/CBS sides, especially those from his exquisite One Year album. Tracks from that include "Say You Don't Mind," a suburb song written by Denny Lane (ex-Moody Blues, future Wings), as well as Blunstone's original "Caroline Goodbye," which very well may be the finest record of 1970. Add to this the impressive tracks from albums like Ennismore and others, and you have the real voice of the 1970s that was sadly under-appreciated and certainly under-heard. Like a gossamer cloth, it sweeps elegant. </review>
