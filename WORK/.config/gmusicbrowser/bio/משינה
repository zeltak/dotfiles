<title>Artist Biography</title>
Mashina (Hebrew: משינה‎) is a pop rock band formed in Israel which was active from 1984 to 1995, and then again from 2003 to the present. The band is considered by many to be Israel's most important and influential rock band. Their musical style took inspiration from ska and hard rock, among others.  Mashina was formed by singer Yuval Banai, a member of the Banai family, probably Israel's best-known family of entertainers; father Yossi was an actor and singer, as are uncles Gabri and Ya'akov, along with most of Yuval's cousins. During his army service he met guitar player Shlomi Bracha and the two started playing music together. A friend of theirs, a recent Russian immigrant, suggested they call their band "Mashina Vremeni", which means "time machine" in Russian (this suggestion may have been inspired by the well-known Russian rock band Mashina Vremeni of the 60's and 70's).  After the army service the two split up; Banai formed the band "Shlom Ha-Tzibur" ("Public Safety"), while Bracha teamed up with bassist Michael Benson to form the band "HaChazit Ha'amamit" ("The National Front"). In 1984 they decide to combine to form a new band, which they called Mashina, bringing in drummer Iggy Dayan; in 1985, they released their self-titled debut, which quickly became a hit on the Israeli charts. Later Avner Hodorov joined the band on keyboard and saxophone. They gained widespread popularity in Israel during the late 80's and early 90's.
